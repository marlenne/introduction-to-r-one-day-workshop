# For teaching purposes let's name the variables in a general way
x <- cas[, c("performance", "student_teacher_ratio", "students_log", "income_log")]

# Overview
?formula
# http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/richard.hahn/teaching/FormulaNotation.pdf

# 1 intercept
# -1 exclude intercept
# The intercept is included by default in linear models, 
# but in other contexts you need to specify it.

lm(dv ~ A, x) # intercept included by default
lm(dv ~ 1 + A, x) # intercept explicitly included (same as above)
lm(dv ~ -1 + A, x) # exclude intercept

# + main effect
lm(dv ~ A + B, x) # main effect of A and B


# * include interaction and main effects
# : just main effect without interactions 
lm(dv ~ A * B, x) # main effects and interactions
lm(dv ~ A:B, x) # no main effects but interaction
lm(dv ~ A + B + A:B, x) # main effects explicitly specified
lm(dv ~ A*B*C, x) # main effects, two-way interactions, three-way interaction
lm(dv ~ (A + B + C)^3, x) # main as above
lm(dv ~ (A + B + C)^2, x) # main effects but only two-way interactions

# You can apply transformations to variables in place
lm(dv ~ scale(A), x) # main effects but only two-way interactions
# this is the same as creating a new variable
# and using he new variable in the model
x$zA <- scale(x$A)
lm(dv ~ zA, x)

# However if the transformation involves symbols that
# have special meaning in the context of R formulas
# i.e., +, -, *, ^, |, :
# then you  # have to wrap it in the I()
# I stands for Inhibit Interpretation or AsIs

# Polynomial regression
lm(dv ~ A + I(A^2), x) # include quadratic effect of A
lm(dv ~ A + I(A^2) + I(A^3), x) # include quadratic and cubic effect of A

# interaction effects with centering
lm(dv ~ A + B + I(scale(A) * scale(B)), x) # z-score centre before creating interaction

# composites
lm(dv ~ I(A + B), x) # include the sum of two variables as a predictor
lm(dv ~ I(2 * A + 5 * B), x) # include the weighted coposte as a predictor
```


# R Factors: Categorical predictors
```{r}
# Factors can be used for categorical variables

# http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/r/modules/factor_variables.htm
library(MASS)
data(survey)
csurvey <- na.omit(survey)
# let's assume a few variables were string variables
csurvey$Sex_character <- as.character(csurvey$Sex)
csurvey$Smoke_character <- as.character(csurvey$Smoke)

# by default character variables will be converted to factors in regression models
lm(Height ~ Sex_character, csurvey)
# by default it performs dummy coding with the first category as the reference category
# By default the ordering of a categorical variable is alphabetical

# levels shows the levels of a factor variable
# Thus, if we convert a sex as a character variable to a factor
# F is before M to it is Female then Male

csurvey$Sex_factor <-  factor(csurvey$Sex_character)
levels(csurvey$Sex_factor)
lm(Height ~ Sex_factor, csurvey)

# Factors also influence the ordering of categorical variables
# in plots
par(mfrow=c(2,1))
plot(Height ~ Sex_factor, csurvey) 
# and the order in tables
table(csurvey$Sex_factor)

# If we wanted to change the order to Male then Female
csurvey$Sex_factor <- factor(csurvey$Sex_character, levels = c("Male", "Female"))
levels(csurvey$Sex_factor)
lm(Height ~ Sex_factor, csurvey) # now male is the reference category
plot(Height ~ Sex_factor, csurvey) 
table(csurvey$Sex_factor)


# Ordered factors
# Factors  
# some factors reflect an ordinal relationship
# e.g., survey frequency-agreement type scales
# For example, see this smoking frequency items
csurvey$Smoke_factor <- factor(csurvey$Smoke)
table(csurvey$Smoke_factor)
# By default it is in the wrong order
csurvey$Smoke_factor <- factor(csurvey$Smoke, c("Never", "Occas", "Regul", "Heavy"))
table(csurvey$Smoke_factor)

# However, we can also influence the type of contrasts performed
csurvey$Smoke_ordered <- factor(csurvey$Smoke, c("Never", "Occas", "Regul", "Heavy"),
                                ordered = TRUE)
# or equivalently
csurvey$Smoke_ordered <- ordered(csurvey$Smoke, c("Never", "Occas", "Regul", "Heavy"))

# When included in linear model, we get
# polynomial contrasts for ordered factors
lm(Pulse ~ Smoke_ordered, csurvey)

# Many data import functions have the option of
# importing string variables as characters or factors
# Some use a general configuration option:
opt <- options()
opt$stringsAsFactors
# e.g., 
# read.table(..., stringsAsFactors = ...) 
# read.csv(..., stringsAsFactors = ...) 

# other functions have explicit options to import as factors
# foreign::read.spss(..., use.value.labels = ...

# Tip: My preference is to import string variables as character variables
# If I want to use factors I prefer to explicitly create them.
