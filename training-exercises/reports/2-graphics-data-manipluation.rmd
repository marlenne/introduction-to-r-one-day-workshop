# Graphics systesms
There are three main graphics packages in R:

* Base graphics
* lattice
* ggplot2

# Base graphics
```{r base graphics}
# scatterplot
plot(csurvey$Pulse, csurvey$Age)
plot(Age ~ Pulse, csurvey)
plot(csurvey$Pulse)

# distribution
hist(csurvey$Pulse, 10) # histogram
stem(csurvey$Pulse) # Stem and leaf plot
plot(density(csurvey$Pulse)) # density plot
boxplot(csurvey$Pulse) # box plot
boxplot(csurvey$Pulse ~ csurvey$Sex) # box plot by group

# categorical variables
plot(csurvey$Smoke)
plot(prop.table(table(csurvey$Smoke)))

# plot covariation of multiple numeric variables 
pairs( csurvey[, c("Wr.Hnd", "Pulse", "Height", "Age") ])
psych::pairs.panels( csurvey[, c("Wr.Hnd", "Pulse", "Height", "Age") ])
```

# Graphics options
```{r base graphics options}
# Base graphics uses a "painting the page metaphor"

# add options to the main plotting functions
plot(csurvey$Pulse, csurvey$Age,
     xlab = "Pulse",  # x-axis label
     ylab = "Age",      # y-axis label
     pch = 2,          # plotting character
     las = 1,         # orientation of axis labels
     xlim = c(0, 110), # x axis limits
     ylim = c(0, 80)   # y axis limits
)

# overlay different elements
title("Pulse by Age") # add title to top of plot
abline(h = mean(csurvey$Age), lty = 2, col = "red") # add straight line
abline(v= mean(csurvey$Pulse), lty = 2, col = "blue")  # add straight line
text(70, 75, "outlier") # add text

# There are various graphic parameters like 
# lty for line type
# col for colour

?par # built-in help for graphics parameters
?plot.default # built-in help 


# Arrange plots in grids
par(mfrow = c(2, 2)) # create grid of plots with 2 rows and 2 columns
plot(Pulse ~ Age, csurvey, main = "Pulse")
plot(Wr.Hnd ~ Age, csurvey,  main = "Writing hand")
plot(NW.Hnd ~ Age, csurvey, main = "Non-writing hand")

# Saving plot
```{r saving base plots}
# Option 1. Click on export in RStudio

# Option 2. Use a graphics device
?Devices # see list of graphics devices

# Step 1. turn on graphics device
# In this case I am using pdf
pdf(file = "output/height-histogram.pdf") 
# Step 2. Run plotting code
hist(csurvey$Height) 

# Step 3. Turn of graphics device
dev.off()
```

# Exercise 1
```{r exercise 1}
# For this exercise will use the GSS7402 dataset
library(AER)
data("GSS7402")
?GSS7402 # to learn about the dataset
# It might be easier to work with a shorter variable name 
gss <- GSS7402

# 1. Use base graphics to create a boxplot for education

# 2.  Create a boxplot for education split by year

# 3. Add some elements to the plot
#    (a) x and y labels,
#    (b) a red horizontal line at 12 years of education

# 4. Save the previous plot as a pdf in the output directory.
#    Paste the document into a word processor (e.g., MS Word)
```


# Answer 1

# 1. Use base graphics to create a boxplot for education

# 2.  Create a boxplot for education split by year

# 3. Add some elements to the plot

#    (b) a red horizontal line at 12 years of education
boxplot(gss$education ~ gss$year, xlab = "Year", ylab = "Education (years)")

# Lattice Plots
```{r lattice plots}

barchart(Wr.Hnd ~  Sex, csurvey)

# saving lattice plots
# same as base but you need to print the plot
pdf(file = "output/lattice-plot.pdf") 
# Step 2. Run plotting code with print
print(xyplot(Wr.Hnd ~ NW.Hnd, csurvey))

# Step 3. Turn of graphics device
dev.off()
```


# ggplot2
```{r ggplot2}

?ais

# See the Rstudio ggplot2 cheatsheet 
# and the ggplot2 documentation: http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/

# specify the data frame and the mapping of variables to plot attributes

# scatter plot
# 1. supply a data.frame
# 2. add aesthetic mapping between variables in data.frame
#    and 
ggplot(ais, aes(x = ht, y = wt)) + geom_point()

# The Hadleyverse
# http://had.co.nz/

# Hadley Wickham is a celebrity in the R world 
# and has developed many new packages that attempt
# to make R more user friendly.
# Most prominently these include the graphics package
# ggplot2 
# as well as several for data manipulation including
# dplyr, tidyr
# You may wish to examine the RStudio Data Wrangling cheat sheet.
# The above data manipulation methods are built into base R.
# Hadley's packages do similar things but you may find them more 
# elegant and consistent.

# examples
library(dplyr)
head(iris)

# A bit like aggregate
dplyr::summarise(cbfi[, v$items], 
                 mean_A1 = mean(A1), sd_A1 = sd(A1))

# Similar to sapply but returns a data.frame
dplyr::summarise_each(cbfi[, v$items], funs(sd))
```


# Exercise 2
```{r exercise 2}
library(psych)
data(bfi)
cbfi <- na.omit(bfi)
dput(names(cbfi))
v <- list()
v$items <- c("A1", "A2", "A3", "A4", "A5", "C1", "C2", "C3", "C4", "C5", 
    "E1", "E2", "E3", "E4", "E5", "N1", "N2", "N3", "N4", "N5", "O1", 
    "O2", "O3", "O4", "O5")

# 1. Get the median of all items in cbfi

# 2. Get the number of times each participant gave 
#    the response of 3 and assign this to a new variable

# 3. Produce frequency counts for each each

# 4. Create a new dataset excluding those over 50
#    and those under 18

# 5. Get the mean of each item by age from this younger sample
