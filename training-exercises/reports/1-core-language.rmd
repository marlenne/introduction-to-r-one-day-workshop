# Basic Arithmetic and Logical Operations
```{r basic_multiplication}
# You can use R like a calculator
1 + 1 # addition
10 - 9 # subtraction
10 * 10 # multiplcation
100 / 10 # division
10 ^ 2 # exponentiation

abs(-10) # absolute value
ceiling(3.5) # round up to next integer
floor(3.5) # round down to next integer
sqrt(100) # square roots
exp(2) # exponents
pi # mathematical constant pi
exp(1) # mathematical constant e
log(100) # natural logs (i.e., base e)
log(100, base= 10) # base 10 logs


# Use parentheses to clarify order of operations
(1 + 1 ) * 2
1 + (1 * 2)

# You can test for equality
# TRUE and FALSE are keywords
# T and F are synonyms, but are generally discouraged
TRUE
FALSE
1 == 2 # Equality (Return TRUE if equal)
1 != 2 # Inequality (Return FALSE if unequal)
10 > 9 # Greater than
9 < 10 # Less than
10 <= 10 # Less than or equal
2 %in% c(1, 2 ,3) # is the number in the vector

# TRUE and FALSE coerces to 1 and 0 respectively
as.numeric(TRUE)
as.numeric(FALSE)

# Logical converting to 0, 1 is useful
x <- c(2, 5 ,7 ,10, 15)
x > 5
sum(x > 5)  # sum of a 0-1 variable is a count
mean(x > 5) # mean of a 0-1 variable is a proportion
```



# Basic language features
```{r basic language features, error = TRUE}
########################################################
# Assignment:
# To assign values to a variable either use <- or =
# <- is the more common convention in R
x <- 1 + 1
x

# = is the common assignment operator in other programming 
# languages. It does work in R, but is not the convention.
y = 1 + 1
y

########################################################
# Variable name rules:
# Variable names generally
# 1. Start with a letter (lower or uppercase)
# 2. Followed by letters, numbers, underscore (_), or period (.)
# 3. No spaces

# These do not work
# my variable <- 1234
# 1234variable <- 1234
# 1234 <- 1234

# This works
myvariable <- 1234
my_variable <- 1234
my_variable <- 1234
myvariable123 <- 1234
myVariable <- 1234
my.variable <- 1234

# R has many naming conventions
# As a matter of preference, style, and convenience, I prefer:
# 1. Short but descriptive names
#    * Less than 8 characters for names of lists and data.frames
#    * Less than 15 characters for variables names in data.frames
# 2. Use underscore to separate words within a variable name
# 3. Avoid upper case letters

# Names starting with a period are hidden
.myvariable <- 1234
ls()
ls(all.names = TRUE)


########################################################
# Comments:
# Comments are any text on a line following a hash #
# 1. They often appear as the first character of a line
#    to present a whole line comment
# 2. At the end of a common on a line
mean(c(1,2,3,4)) # Example of end of line comment

# 3. Half way through a command at the end of a line
c(1, # Example comment
  2,3,   # Another comment
  4)
  

########################################################
# Spaces: 
# R will generally permits zero, one or more spaces between
# variables, operators, and other syntactic elements. 
# However, appropriate and consistent spacing improves
# the readability of you scripts.
# See Hadley Wickham's style guide:
# http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html

# This is bad but works
x<-c(1,2,3,400)*2
x<-    c (   1,2,3,      400)*   2

# This is more readable:
# Add spaces after variables, operators, commas
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 400) * 2


######################################################
# Multipline line commands
# Commands can generally span multiple lines
# as long as R does not think the command has finished 

# This works
x <- c("apple", 
       "banana") 
x
y <- 10 + 
    10  #this works
y

# This does not work
y <- 10
    + 10 
y


########################################################
# Multiple commands on one line
# You can include more than one command on one line 
# by separat the commands by a semicolon.
# But generally, you should avoid doing this as it is not
# very readable.
x <- c(1, 2); y  <- c(3, 4); z <- rnorm(10)
x;y;z


########################################################
# # R is case sensitive
test <- "lower case"
TEST <- "upper case"
TEST 
test # The original value was not lost
     # because test is different to TEST
Test # This variable does not exist

Test <- "title case"
Test


# tip: It's often simpler to make variables lower case
#      so that you don't have to think about case.
```


# Understanding directories
```{r directories}
# R has a working directory.
# This is important when loading and saving files to disk
getwd() # show the current working directory

# you can use setwd to change the working directory
# setwd("~/blah/myproject")

# Tip: Open RStudio with the Rproj file then the working directory
# will be the directory containing the Rproj file.

# Tips: 
# * Try to avoid spaces in file names 
#   (use hyphen or underscore instead)
# * If on Windows, then disable "hide extensions of 
#   known file types" (see folder options )
# * If you do use spaces, then you'll need to escape the space with
#   a slash  (e.g., ("my\ documents")
# * Use backslash as the directory separator 
# * Store all relevant files for a project within 
#   the project working directory
```

# The Workspace
```{r workspace}
###############################################
# R Sessions:

# Quitting R
# You can end the R Session using the q function
# q() 

# But if you are in Rstudio, it is simpler to:
# * Just quit RStudio and this will quit the R session
# * Use the session menu in RStudio to Restart or Terminate
#   an R session


################################################
# Workspaces and environments:
# list environments 
search()

# Create some objects in the global environment
x <- 1:10
y <- 1:20
data(mtcars) # Add a built-in datset mtcars

# Show objects in the global environment
ls() 

# or look at the environment pane in RStudio

###############################################
# Removing objects:
# Removing named objects with the rm function
rm(x)
ls()
rm(y, mtcars)

# Remove all objects from global workspace
# Option 1. Use the following command
rm(list = ls())
# Option 2. Click the broom object in RStudio Environment pane

##############################################
# Saving objects
# Save all objects in the workspace
save.image() 

x <- 30
y <- 1:10
# Save specific named objects using save function.
# rdata or RData is the standard file exetnsion.
save(x, y, file = "output/y.rdata") 

# Let's remove x and change y
rm(x) 
y <- "changed"
y

# load variables stored in rdata file 
load(file = "output/y.rdata")
x
y

# Tips: 
# * Try to avoid using save.image() to store temporary calculations
# * Instead, try to write scripts that can be run to return you to 
#   your current state of analyses.
```

 
# Data types: Logical, character, numeric
```{r data types}
#######################################################
# Basic data types
# The most common basic vector types are
x <- c(FALSE, TRUE) # logical vector
y <- c("a", "b", "cat", "dog") # character vector
z1 <- c(100, 1, 2, 3) # numeric integer vector
z2 <- c(100.2, 0.4, 0.9) # numeric real/double vector
class(x);  typeof(x); mode(x)
class(y);  typeof(y); mode(y)
class(z1);  typeof(z1); mode(z1)
class(z2);  typeof(z2); mode(z2)

# Checking type of object
# there are a range of "is." functions for that return TRUE
# if object is of corresponding type
# apropos("^is\\.")
is.logical(c(TRUE, TRUE))
is.numeric(c("a", "b"))
is.character(c(1, 2, 3))

#############################################################
# Conversion of Types:
# R has functions that explicitly convert data types
# apropos("^as\\.")
as.character(c(1, 2, 3, 4))
as.numeric(c("1", "2a", "3", "four"))
as.numeric(c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE))

# R often performs conversions implicitly
sum(c(FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)) # converts logical to 0, 1 numeric
paste0("v", c(1, 2, 3)) # converts numeric vector to character
```

# Basic data structures: Vectors, Matrices, Lists, Data.frames
```{r basic data structures}
###########################################################
# Vectors:
# In R, a single value (scalar) is a vector.
x <- 1 # I.e., x is a vector of length 1


# In addition to importing data,
# R has various functions for creating vectors.
c(1, 2, 3, 4) # c stands for combine
1:10 # create an integer sequence 1 to 10
seq(1, 10) # alternative way of creating a sequence 
seq(1, 10, by = 2) # The function has additional options
rep(1, 5) # repeat a value a certain number of times
rep(c(1,2,3), 5) # repeat a value a certain number of times

# as well as many simulation functions which we'll cover later
# Initial examples:
# Sample 10 items with replacement from 
sample(x = c("happy", "funny", "silly"), size = 10, replace = TRUE)

# Sample 20 values from a normal distribution
y <- rnorm(n = 20, mean = 0, sd = 1) 
hist(y) # show values in histogram


# Vectors can have names
x <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
names(x) <- c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e")
x

# Extracting vectors
x[c(1,2)] # by numeric position
x[x < 3] # by logical vector
x[c("b", "c")] # by name




###########################################################
# Matrices:
# All data must be of same type (e.g., numeric, character, logical)
y <- matrix(c(1, 2, 
             4, 5, 
             7, 8 ),
           byrow = TRUE, ncol = 2)
y

class(y)

# number of rows and columns
dim(y)  # Number of rows and columns
nrow(y) # Number of rows
ncol(y) # Number of columns

# Rows and columns can be given names
rownames(y) <- c("a", "b", "c")
colnames(y) <- c("col1", "col2")

# Rows and columns can be indexed
y["a", ] # By rowname
y[, "col1"] # By column name 
y["a", "col1"] # By both

y[c(1,2), ] # By row position
y[,1] # By column position
y[c(2,3), 2] # By column position

###########################################################
# Lists
# Store arbitrary structures of one or more named elements.
# Elements can be of different lengths
# Lists can contain lists can be nested to create tree like structures
# Lists are commonly used for representing results of analyses

w <- list(apple = c("a", "b", "c"), 
          banana = c(1,2), 
          carrot = FALSE,
          animals = list(dog = c("dog1", "dog2"), 
                         cat = c(TRUE, FALSE)))

class(w)

# Accessing one element of list
w$apple # using dollar notation
w[[1]] # by position
w[["apple"]] # by name (double brackets)

# Accessing subset of list
w[c(1, 2)]  # by position (single bracket)
w[c("apple", "banana")] # by name
w[c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)] # by logical vector

# Quick illustration of a list object returned by
# a statistical function

# We'll simulate some data for two hypothetical groups x and y
# and perform an independent samples t-test.
x <- rnorm(10, mean = 0, sd = 1) 
y <- rnorm(10, mean = 1, sd = 1)
fit <- t.test(x, y)  

# The function 
class(fit) # class does not say list, but it is a list
mode(fit)
str(fit) # show structure of object
names(fit) # show names of elements
# we can view particular elements
fit$statistic 
fit$parameter
fit$p.value
# or extract subsets of the list
fit[c("statistic", "parameter", "p.value")]


###########################################################
# Data Frames:
# Data frames are the standard data strucure used for storing
# data. If you have used other software (e.g., SPSS, Excel, etc.), 
# this is what you may think of as a "dataset".
# Columns can be of different data types (e.g., character, numeric, logical, etc.)
z <- data.frame(var1 = 1:9, var2 = letters[1:9])
z

# Tip: Some functions work with matrices, 
#   some work with data.frames, 
#   and some work with both.
# * If you are wanting to store data like you might store in 
#   a database, then you'll generaly want a data.frame.
# * If you are dealing with a mathematical object that you
#   you want to perform a mathematical operation on, then you generally
#   want a matrix (e.g., correlation matrix, covariance matrix, 
#   distance matrix in MDS, matrices used for matrix algebra).
```





# Working with data frames
```{r exploring data frames}
# Let's use the built-in survey data.frame dataset

shortdata[c(5,4,3,2,1), ] # re-order
shortdata[ shortdata$Sex == "Female", ] # by logical vector
shortdata[c("1", "2"), ] # by rownames

# Select variables

# Packages
```{r packages}
# R has many additional packages 
# To use a package it needs to be installed. 
# You only need to install a package once.
# To use a package, you need to load the package each time
# you use R.


##############################################################
# Installation
# Option 1. Use the install.packages function.
# install.packages("psych")
# Note that some packages rely on other packages.
# depencies = TRUE ensures that dependencies are also installed.
# install.packages("psych", dependencies = TRUE)

# Option 2. Use the package tab in R Studio
# Click install and enter package details


##############################################################
# Loading an installed package
# Option 1. Use the library function
library(psych) # I.e., put this at the start of your script

# Other options 
# 2. We'll talk about ProjectTemplate later
#
# 3. Put it in your R startup file 
#    (not recommended as it reduces reproducibility)

##############################################################
# Packages contain additional functions.
# Once the package is loaded, functions are added to the workspace
# list workspace
search()

# To make it clear that a function comes from a particular package
# or to overcome the issue where two packages have functions with the same names
# use double colon (i.e., package::function).
# RStudio also permits auto-completion of function names.
# psych::alpha() # alpha is a funtion in the psych package

is.na(x)

# If you have missing data, some functions will return NA by default
# rather than returning a value
mean(x)
sd(x)

# Many functions have a na.rm argument
mean(x, na.rm=TRUE)
sd(x, na.rm=TRUE)

# or you remove the missing data

# Random variables and distributions
```{r random variables and distributions}
# In statistics, we often want to generate random data with certain properties
# or looking up features of statistical distributions.
# See the following help for list of common distributions is base R
?Distributions

# and see http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Distributions.html for many more distributions

# Each distribution has four functions that differ in terms of the first letter
# For example, for the normal distribution, you have
dnorm(1) # Density of the value 1 of a standard normal distribution
pnorm(1) # Cumulative distribution function for value of 1 on standard normal distribution
qnorm(.975) # Inverse cumulative distribution function for value of .975
rnorm(5) # Generate 5 random draws from normal distribution

# 
dunif(1) # Density of the value 1 of a uniform distribution (0, 1)
punif(.5) # Cumulative distribution function for value of 1 on uniform distribution
qunif(.975) # Inverse cumulative distribution function for value of .975
runif(5) # Generate 5 random draws from uniform distribution


# Distributions have parameters that can be specified
x <- rnorm(10, mean = 10, sd = 1) # draw 10 from mean of 10
y <- rnorm(10, mean = 11, sd = 1) # draw 10 from mean of 11
dat <- data.frame(x=x, y=y)
dat
boxplot(dat)
```


# Functions
```{r functions}
# You can write functions and these are generally the same as
# the functions you use in R

# For example, I could create a function that printed some text
print_some_text <- function(x = "Hello World") {
    print(x)
}

# If I run the above command, I can then use it
print_some_text() # using the default argument
print_some_text("blah blah blah")  # or to print some other text

# Anatomy of a function 
# Functions have a name
# They take one or more arguments
# Arguments may have default values


# Let's take a more interesting example: Power analysis
# The following data simulates data for two groups and
# examines whether there is a significant difference at .05
# It repeats the process 1000 times and calculates the
# proportion of times it is statistically significant
# (i.e., simluation estimate of the statistical power)
