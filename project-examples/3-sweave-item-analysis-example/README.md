This document provides an example of using Sweave 
to record console input and output.
Such a format is useful for several purposes including
R tutorials, informal analyses, and analyses that will be consumed
by readers knowledgeable about a specific project and about R.
The example involves performing an item analysis of 
student responses  
to a set of multiple choice test items.
The test items were developed by students as part of an informal
class exercise.
They are by design of widely varying quality and difficulty.

# Requirements
The code was tested with: 

* R 2.11.1
* R Tools 2.11 (i.e., one way of getting `make`)
* It requires R packages: `CTT` and `psych`

# To Run

* Download repository
* Run `make` in the project home directory.
This will run Sweave on the Rnw file.

# The resulting file

A copy of the resulting PDF is available in the `.backup` folder.
